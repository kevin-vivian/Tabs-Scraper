I want this web scraper to go through the entire abysslord website and get all 
the files in every directory.

Inside parent directory:
   <a href="(album_title)/(album_title).html"


   Inside album directory (i.e. where all my files are):
      sample entry:
            <a href="(song_title).(format)" target="_blank"> (format) </a>

             # where (format) in {.txt, .pdf, .ptb, gpx}

      The URL hosting the files follow the convention:
         regex: (number)-(song_title).(format)

for every <a href..> entry on the webpage:
  if the <a href...> has our regex:
     create a directory named after the song
     download every file format
